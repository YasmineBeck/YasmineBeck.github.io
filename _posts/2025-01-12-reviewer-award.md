I am excited to share that I received the [INFORMS Journal on Computing Meritorious Reviewer Award 2024](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/ijoc.2025.merits.v37.n2). Congratulations also to all my fellow awardees, keep up the great work!

Despite my rather young academic career, I have seen both excellent and, well, not-so-great reviews. Knowing how frustrating unconstructive feedback can be, I am happy to be recognized as one of the better reviewers.
