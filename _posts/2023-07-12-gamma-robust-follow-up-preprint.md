We have been teasing it for a while but now it is done: Our preprint "An Extension of the Bertsimas & Sim Result for Discrete, Linear, and $\Gamma$-Robust Min-Max Problems" (jointly with Ivana Ljubic and Martin Schmidt) is [online](https://optimization-online.org/2023/07/an-extension-of-the-bertsimas-sim-result-for-discrete-linear-and-%ce%b3-robust-min-max-problems/).  

We show that the famous result by Bertsimas and Sim for $\Gamma$-robust single-level problems can be extended to the $\Gamma$-robust bilevel min-max setting. This means that we can obtain optimal $\Gamma$-robust solutions by solving a polynomial number of min-max problems of the nominal type. This can make a huge difference when considering bilevel problems computationally. However, the situation becomes more challenging when general discrete $\Gamma$-robust bilevel problems are considered. Interested?
