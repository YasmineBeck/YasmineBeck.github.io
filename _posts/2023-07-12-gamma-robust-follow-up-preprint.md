We have been teasing it for a while but now it is done: Our preprint "An Extension of the Bertsimas & Sim Result for Discrete, Linear, and $\Gamma$-Robust Min-Max Problems" (jointly with Ivana Ljubic and Martin Schmidt) is [online](https://optimization-online.org/2023/07/an-extension-of-the-bertsimas-sim-result-for-discrete-linear-and-%ce%b3-robust-min-max-problems/).
