You just could not miss $\Gamma$-robust bilevel optimization if you attended the "International Conference on Bilevel Optimization" 2023 in Southampton. Not only did I have the pleasure to talk about our work on $\Gamma$-robust bilevel optimization but also my two amazing co-authors and plenary speakers Ivana Ljubic and Martin Schmidt. You can find all the details [here](https://www.springer.com/journal/12532) and [here](https://optimization-online.org/2023/07/an-extension-of-the-bertsimas-sim-result-for-discrete-linear-and-%ce%b3-robust-min-max-problems/).
